 *
 *
 *      The YCRCB (Luminosity, Chroma Red, Chroma Blue) Chart in the file below, is a
 *      great reference for OPENCV Camera detection and what color you should use for
 *      your team prop/element or item that you need to detect. But in order to detect a
 *      color based on the section you want, you will have to change the COI in the
 *      pipeline code. COI 0 will put you in the category of the Y category (Luminosity).
 *      COI 1 will put you in the category of Chroma Red (CR). COI 2 will put you
 *      in the category Chroma Blue (CB).
